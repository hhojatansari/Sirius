# Sirius Project

**Sirius** is the brightest star in the night sky, also called the Dog Star.  
For centuries, it has been used in navigation as a symbol of orientation and reliability.

This project is a **healthcare-focused system** designed to provide quick access to critical patient information in emergencies.  
At the same time, it serves as a **learning and experimental platform** for exploring **DevOps, MLOps, and system design practices**.
